[Link to the Report](digit-recognizer.ipynb)

### Aim of the Assignment
The task is to create a digit recognizer, calculate its accuracy metrix, and create predictions with the model.

### About the Dataset
Source: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/mnist/load_data) \
The data contains 60,000 gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine. Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Dataset comes with a test set of 10,000 images.
